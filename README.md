### Covid-19 Detection from Chest X-Ray 

#### In this project, I have used TensorFlow and Keras. Also, I have used DenseNet architecture for classifying the chest X-ray.

The Dataset is collected from the following resources: <br>
[1] Covid Chest X-ray Dataset [here](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) <br>
[2] Chest X-ray Images [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

Follow [this notebook](https://github.com/supritighosh/COVID-19_Detection_from_Chest_X-ray/blob/main/diagnoise-covid-19-chest-x-ray.ipynb) to perform the classification task.
