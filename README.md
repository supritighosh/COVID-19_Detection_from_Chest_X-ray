### Covid-19 Detection from Chest X-Ray 

In this project, I have used two architectures for classifying the chest X-ray and they are DenseNet and ResNet.<br>
[1] I have used TensorFlow and Keras in DenseNet architecture and the weight I have used here is DenseNet169.<br>
[2] In another project, I have used Keras and pandas in ResNet architecture and the weight I have used here is ResNet50.


The Dataset is collected from the following resources: <br>
[1] Covid Chest X-ray Dataset [here](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) <br>
[2] Chest X-ray Images [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

Follow [this notebook](https://github.com/supritighosh/COVID-19_Detection_from_Chest_X-ray/tree/main/Code) to perform the classification task.
